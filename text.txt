What is it:

more than an ilustrated pattern what replacing inheritance with composition may look like. The frmwrk strives to provide some universal way to do it.

not specific for web development but seeks its use ..
declarative & not complex architecture but with commonplace needs like encapsulation. Yet it's not restrictive to web in any way.

from not too long use of django + django-rest-framework

put inheritance on the right level: app should be _composable_ from parts, and that parts ca be inherited.


pattern: simple examples of ContextAttribute (patched) -> current impl





- native client (pattern2: testable parts)

    we have admin interface and miss developer interface

    can have smth like admin interface for a view (url) (picture?)

    iterate results for a request

- pattern


- autopilot for app


++
testing should not get harder if he have say, templates based app instead of api
